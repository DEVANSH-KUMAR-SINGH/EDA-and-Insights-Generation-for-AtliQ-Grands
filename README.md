# 📊 AtliQ Grands — Hospitality Data Analysis (EDA)

AtliQ Grands is a hospitality chain operating multiple hotel properties. This project performs an **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on AtliQ Grands’ historical booking and hotel performance data to uncover trends, operational insights, and revenue patterns.

The analysis is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook using Python data analytics libraries.

---

## 🚀 Project Objectives

- Import and explore raw datasets  
- Clean and transform booking and hotel data  
- Perform descriptive and visual analysis  
- Generate insights useful for business decision-making in hospitality

---

## 🗂️ Datasets Used

The project uses five CSV files:

- `dim_date.csv`
- `dim_hotels.csv`
- `dim_rooms.csv`
- `fact_aggregated_bookings.csv`
- `fact_bookings.csv`

These files collectively describe hotel properties, rooms, bookings, and dates.

## 📑 Analysis Workflow

The notebook is structured in the following steps:

1. **Data Import & Exploration**  
   Load datasets and perform initial inspection.

2. **Data Cleaning**  
   Handle duplicates, missing values, inconsistent fields.

3. **Data Transformation**  
   Create calculated fields and merge datasets for analysis.

4. **Insights Generation**  
   Identify booking trends, performance metrics, and patterns.

## 🎯 Key Learnings from the Project

- Gained hands-on experience in performing **end-to-end Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on real-world hospitality datasets.
- Learned how to **clean, preprocess, and merge multiple relational datasets** (hotel, rooms, booking, and date dimensions).
- Developed an understanding of **hotel business metrics** such as occupancy, booking volume, revenue trends, and room performance.
- Identified **seasonality patterns and demand fluctuations**, helping to interpret operational and market behavior.
- Improved proficiency in **data wrangling using pandas** and **data visualization using matplotlib and seaborn**.
- Enhanced ability to derive **actionable business insights from raw data** to support decision-making.
- Strengthened skills in **storytelling with data** through structured analysis and well-designed visual summaries.
- Practiced organizing a data project for GitHub with a **clean, professional repository structure and documentation**.
